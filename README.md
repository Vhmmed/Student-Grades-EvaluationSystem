# Student-Grades-EvaluationSystem
This project is a simple Dart console application that allows students to input their grades and get an evaluation for each subject along with their total marks and percentage.
Features:

    Prompts the user to enter their name.

    Requests grades for a predefined list of subjects (e.g., Math, Physics, Data, etc.).

    Stores the grades in a List for processing.

    Calculates and displays the total marks.

    Calculates the percentage based on the maximum possible score.

    Outputs the final result in a clean and formatted way.

Learning Objectives:

    Practice using loops in Dart.

    Store and manipulate data using Lists.

    Handle user input via stdin.

    Implement conditional statements (if-else) for evaluations.

    Use ANSI color codes to style console output.

    Perform total and percentage calculations dynamically.
